DLTK is a neural networks toolkit written in python, on top of [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow). It is developed to enable fast prototyping with a low entry threshold and ensure reproducibility in image analysis applications, with a particular focus on medical imaging. Its goal is  to provide the community with state of the art methods and models and to accelerate research in this exciting field.


### Documentation
The DLTK API can be found [here](https://dltk.github.io/)

### Installation
1. Install CUDA with cuDNN and add its path in ~/.bashrc by sourcing setup.sh:

```shell
source MY_CUDA_PATH/setup.sh
```

2. Setup a virtual environment and activate it:

```shell
virtualenv venv_tf
source venv_tf/bin/activate
```

3a. Install DLTK directly from pypi as is:
```shell
pip install dltk
```

3b. Clone the source and install DLTK (including all dependencies) via pip in edit mode:

```shell
cd MY_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY
git clone https://github.com/DLTK/DLTK.git 
cd DLTK
pip install -e .
```
This will allow you to modify the actual DLTK source code and import that modified source wherever you need it via ```import dltk```.


### Start playing

1. Downloading example data
   You will find download and preprocessing scripts for publicly available datasets in ```data```. To download the IXI HH dataset, navigate to ```data/IXI_HH``` and run the download script with ```python download_IXI_HH.py```.


2. Tutorial notebooks
   In ```examples/tutorials``` you will find tutorial notebooks to better understand on how DLTK interfaces with tensorflow, how to write custom read functions and how to write your own ```model_fn```.   
   
   To run a notebook, navigate to the DLTK source root folder and open a notebook server on ```MY_PORT``` (default 8888):
   
   ```shell
   cd MY_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY/DLTK
   jupyter notebook --ip=* --port MY_PORT
   ```   
   Open a browser and enter the address ```http://localhost:MY_PORT``` or ```http://MY_DOMAIN_NAME:MY_PORT```. You can then navigate to a notebook in ```examples/tutorials```, open it (c.f. extension .ipynb) and modify or run it.

3. Example applications
   There are several example applications in ```examples/applications``` using the data in 1. These are only for demonstration purposes and are not tuned for performance. Please refer to the notes in the examples' README.md.
