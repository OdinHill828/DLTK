## Sex classification from 3T multi-channel brain MR images
Exemplary training and evaluation scripts for classification from multi-sequence (T1w, T2w, PD) brain MR images, based on the [IXI dataset](http://brain-development.org/ixi-dataset/) [1]. 

[1] IXI â€“ Information eXtraction from Images (EPSRC GR/S21533/02)



### Data
The data can be downloaded via the script in $DLTK_SRC/data/IXI_HH/. It includes 178 datasets and corresponding demographic information. The download script
 - produces a CSV file containing demographic information
 - validates the completeness of all imaging data for each database entry
 - resamples the images to 1mm isotropic resolution
 - removes .tar files and original images

demographic_HH.csv:
```IXI_ID,"SEX_ID (1=m, 2=f)",HEIGHT,WEIGHT,ETHNIC_ID,MARITAL_ID,OCCUPATION_ID,QUALIFICATION_ID,DOB,DATE_AVAILABLE,STUDY_DATE,AGE
IXI012,1,175,70,1,2,1,5,1966-08-20,1,2005-06-01,38.7816563997
IXI013,1,182,70,1,2,1,5,1958-09-15,1,2005-06-01,46.7104722793
...
```

In `train.py`, the CSV is parsed and split into a training and validation set. A custom `reader.py` extracts tf.Tensor examples for training and evaluation in using a [SimpleITK](http://www.simpleitk.org/) for  i/o of the .nii files:

```...
t1 = sitk.GetArrayFromImage(sitk.ReadImage(t1_fn))
t2 = sitk.GetArrayFromImage(sitk.ReadImage(t2_fn))
pd = sitk.GetArrayFromImage(sitk.ReadImage(pd_fn))
...

```

### Notes 
In this example we use the first 150 datasets for training, the rest for validation. Here are some quick statistics on the sets:

All subjects:
Sex: mean = 1.51, sd = 0.50, var = 0.25, min = 1.00, max = 2.00

Training subjects:
Sex: mean = 1.54, sd = 0.50, var = 0.25, min = 1.00, max = 2.00

Evaluation subjects:
Sex: mean = 1.36, sd = 0.48, var = 0.23, min = 1.00, max = 2.00


### Usage
- To train a new model, run the train.py script:

  ```python -u train.py $MY_OPTIONS```

  The model and training events will be saved to a temporary folder: `/tmp/IXI_sex_classification`.

- For monitoring and metric tracking, spawn a tensorboard webserver and point the log directory to the model save_path:

  ```tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/IXI_sex_classification/```

- To deploy a model and run inference, run the deploy.py script and point to the model save_path:

  ```python -u deploy.py --save_path=/tmp/IXI_sex_classification $MY_OPTIONS```
